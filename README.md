NexiaAPI is on [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/). So the JitPack repository needs to be added in **pom.xml**.
```xml
<repository>

  <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>
```

Finally NexiaAPI needs to be added as a dependency in *pom.xml**. (Replace **[VERSION]** with the version you want to use.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.NexiaDevelopers</groupId>
  <artifactId>NexiaAPI</artifactId>
  <version>[VERSION]</version>
</dependency>
```
